## Using WebStorm
Installations Required:
- Download Webstorm Student Version: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world
- Install GIT: https://git-scm.com/downloads

Steps:
1. Create a GitHub account: https://github.com/join
2. Open Webstorm and create a new project, where you can choose HTML.
3. In the toolbar, click on the VCS tab.
4. Click on the "Enable Version Control" option. You will get a popup with a drop-down menu, make sure it says "GIT". This will enable GIT for your project.
5. In the upper right-hand corner, click on the gear icon and then "Settings" to open the settings.
6. In the left-hand panel, under the "Version Control" category, click on "GitHub".
7. Click on the "+" sign and then "Log In via Github". You will be redirected to a JetBrains webpage in your default browser. You will be asked to authorize and log into Github, which will allow you to push code from your WebStorm.
8. Back in Webstorm, you will now see that the toolbar says "Git" instead of "VCS". You can click here, and then move your mouse down to "GitHub". There's an option to "Share Project to GitHub".
9. You can give your repository a name and then click "Share".
10. If you return to GitHub, you will see that your account has a new repository!
11. In WebStorm, you can now start creating webpages. When decide you want to save your work, there is a tab on the left-hand side that says "Commit". You can select what files you want to save your work in, and then add a commit message. You can then decide to save your current version locally (Commit), or you can push the changes to GitHub too (Commit and Push...).
12. If you commit and push your changes, you will see those changes reflected on your GitHub page! How cool!

Notes
- You can also create new Repositories from within GitHub! From your account home page, there is a button that says "New" on the left-hand side. This button will prompt a new page for you to make a repository.
- If you want to connect this new repository to WebStorm, you can go to "File" > "New" > "Project from Version Control". This will bring up a pop-up. You can either paste the URL of the repository you want to clone, or you can select an existing repository from your GitHub account by clicking "GitHub" on the left-hand side and viewing your existing repositories. You can then select "Clone" and follow steps 11 and 12 above.

## Glossary

**Branch** - A parallel version of a repository, allowing you to make changes without those changes immediately going live

**Clone** - A copy of a repository so you can edit your files in a place other than a server or Github. You can also edit a clone offline.

**Commit** - A change to a file or set of files that you want to record. Committing keeps track of specific changes along with a message about the change(s), who made the change(s), and when the change(s) were made.

**Fetch** - Similar to pulling, fetching allows you to retrieve any changes to the remote repository to your local branch and review the changes before committing them to your local repository.

**GIT** - an open-source program for tracking changes. This program is the foundation of GitHub

**Github** - a code  hosting platform for version control and collaborationn

**Merge** - when you take the changes from one branch and apply the changes to another branch

**Merge Conflict** - when there are two different changes to the same line of a file, or someone edits a file that someone else deleted. 

**Push** - to send committed changes to the remote repository

**Pull** - to retrieve changes and merge them from the remote repository to your local repository

**Remote** - the version of a repository/branch that is hosted outside of your local machine, such as on GitHub

**Repository** - the equivalent of a folder on GitHub, where all the files relating to one project are stored
